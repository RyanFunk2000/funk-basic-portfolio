# Overview

I have a primary interest in back-end development, functional programming, and working in teams to solve technical problems and build software. As I develop these skills and learn various languages, I become qualified for a career in computing when I graduate BYU Idaho with a major in Computer Science.

This repository contains software that demonstate my proficiency to code in multiple different programming languages.

By showcasing my wide experience in building software, I communicate my ability to perform well in any development environment at a business.
